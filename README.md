Aplha version:

V> 0.8.0
Version so far supports all the character formulas for calculate all formulas from the first admin post with formulas.
Calculator doest contemplate yet, Base values like
Base Damage
Base ASR
Base DSR
Health
Health Per Level
Base Health
Base Attack Speed

for example, if you create an elf in lvl 1 it already has 30 Attack Speed.
So when you run the calculator for a elf lvl 1 the attack speed will be 0.
